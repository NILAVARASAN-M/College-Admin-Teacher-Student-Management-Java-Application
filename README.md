## Problem Statement üéØ

In many universities, including our university the below problem arises.
- **Problem 1:** The faculty In their allocated slot according to thier respective Time-Table, may take emergency leave (or) may not be available. This slot may become wasted by not informing about the free slot to other  faculty's.
- **Problem 2:** Suppose if an faculty is willing to take an Free Period (or) another faculty is willing to take the respective faculty's period. Then Students may not be informed About this Priorly.

## Problem Solution üí°
Our Java-Application Helps to solve the above shortcomings faced in our University.
- **Solution For Problem 1:** The faculty will apply thier emergency leave to the admin, and the admin should approve. If approved then that free-period is informed to all other faculties, who currenty have free-period.
And it is an First Come First Serve, who accepts first, will be granted that respective slot.
- **Solution For Problem 2:** If an Faculty is going to take an free-period (or) other Faculty Period, then the informations is send to all the other Student's priorly.

## Description üí¨
The project was built to solve the **Problems** discussed above, using the **Solution** given Above, using Java, **JavaFX**, csv etc. The Project includes Two Web-Portal's one for the Admin and the for Faculty's. The Project includes UI many other features, which give an outline off how th problem is solved.

## Feautres üöÄ
Following are the JavaFX file's, and thier role in the project. There are Two sections's, one includes all the files for the working of the Teacher's-Portal, and the other set of file's for working of the Admin's-Portal.

### üè´ Teacher Side Portal

This are the files-names, which are in the `https://github.com/NILAVARASAN-M/College-Admin-Teacher-Student-Management-Java-Application/tree/master/codes/src/main/java/com/example/demo1` and the below file's Together run for the working of Teacher's-Portal.
- Step1

This is the Home-Page that it is the first Page that open's when the Faculty Open's thier respective portal. [Click Here](https://github.com/NILAVARASAN-M/College-Admin-Teacher-Student-Management-Java-Application/blob/master/website%20images/teacher/Step1.png) 
- Step2

This is the Verification-Page, it appears when a new faculty is joining.  The credendetials, for this  will be given by the admin to the respective teacher. Will be unique for each Teacher, and can be used for sigining in, once signed up. [Click Here](https://github.com/NILAVARASAN-M/College-Admin-Teacher-Student-Management-Java-Application/blob/master/website%20images/teacher/Step2.png) 

- Step3

Once the verification-page verifies that the teacher is a new faculty added by the admin, this sign-up page appers. They have to include thier respective personal mail-ID, password. Now they can use this mail-ID and pass word for sigining-in. [Click Here](https://github.com/NILAVARASAN-M/College-Admin-Teacher-Student-Management-Java-Application/blob/master/website%20images/teacher/Step3.png) 

- Step4

The faculty fills all the extra-details shown in this page, this page appears after signing-up. All this details are stored, as thier profile. [Click Here](https://github.com/NILAVARASAN-M/College-Admin-Teacher-Student-Management-Java-Application/blob/master/website%20images/teacher/Step4.png)  

- Step5

This is the sign-in page, the faculty can sign-in only after they have done verification/ sign-up etc. Have to use the mail-ID and the password provided in the sign-up page. [Click Here](https://github.com/NILAVARASAN-M/College-Admin-Teacher-Student-Management-Java-Application/blob/master/website%20images/teacher/Step5.png) 

- Step6

Appears whenever the faculty sign's-in, there will be some options listed. That are things the teachers can do.[Click Here](https://github.com/NILAVARASAN-M/College-Admin-Teacher-Student-Management-Java-Application/blob/master/website%20images/teacher/Step1.png)
