## Problem Statement üéØ

In many universities, including our university the below problem arises.
- **Problem 1:** The faculty In their allocated slot according to thier respective Time-Table, may take emergency leave (or) may not be available. This slot may become wasted by not informing about the free slot to other  faculty's.
- **Problem 2:** Suppose if an faculty is willing to take an Free Period (or) another faculty is willing to take the respective faculty's period. Then Students may not be informed About this Priorly.

## Problem Solution üí°
Our Java-Application Helps to solve the above shortcomings faced in our University.
- **Solution For Problem 1:** The faculty will apply thier emergency leave to the admin, and the admin should approve. If approved then that free-period is informed to all other faculties, who currenty have free-period.
And it is an First Come First Serve, who accepts first, will be granted that respective slot.
- **Solution For Problem 2:** If an Faculty is going to take an free-period (or) other Faculty Period, then the informations is send to all the other Student's priorly.

## Description üí¨
The project was built to solve the **Problems** discussed above, using the **Solution** given Above, using Java, **JavaFX**, csv etc. The Project includes Two Web-Portal's one for the Admin and the for Faculty's. The Project includes UI many other features, which give an outline off how th problem is solved.
